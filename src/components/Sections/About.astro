    <p class="prose prose-zinc dark:prose-invert text-center text-lg">
        My name is Kyrylo, and I'm {`${new Date().getFullYear() - 2004} years`} old. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Ivan Franko
        National University of Lviv, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree. I became interested in programming at the age of 12. My first program was written in C++, but I
        found my passion in web development, as I can make programs that anyone can access without any pain. I'm positioning
        myself as a full-stack developer with my core stack being React/Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.

        Aside from programming and technology-related stuff, I love history and enjoy playing chess, and have a second-class chess rank.
